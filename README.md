# cvGDI

Written for my own needs set of drawing functions.
Not all functionl added but a lot of functions works fine.
It planned to support different line properties for all primitives: antialiasng, line patterns, transparency, color, thickness.
Supported primitives: lines, ellipses, rotated ellipses, splines, rectangles, ...
